Project for the [Udactity Android Developer Nanodegree by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

To run the app you need an api key. You can create one here: [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Save the key in the [`gradle.properties`](gradle.properties) file.

**App is currently under development for stage 2. Maybe it will not run / compile.**
